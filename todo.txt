FINAL CHANGES


JOB SEEKER SIDE

-> Profile Completion Percent added (email, phone, qualification, resume, profile pic), each of these fields contributes 20%, totaling 100%.

-> A job seeker can apply only if the profile completion percent is 80 or above.

->Option to add or delete a skill is added in the profile section, and clicking on a skill will remove it from the profile.

-> In the home page, when we go to the jobs section, we can see a button 'View more based on my skills'. Clicking this button will filter jobs based on the skills added.

-> In the home page navbar, an option 'Support' is added where the user can select a company and raise a support ticket to the company.



ADMIN/ COMPANY SIDE

-> When accepting a job application from the admin, we will ask for a datetime from the admin and send that time as the interview datetime to the job seeker.

-> If the application is accepted, then we will show an option to add the applicant as an employee in the admin job application section.

-> In the admin home, there is a search field where we can search with skills or location (skill is required and location is optional).

-> In the candidate search results, there is an option 'Interested', and if the admin clicks on that, we will send a notification to the candidate.

-> Admin can now see all support tickets created from the Dashboard.
